"announcement": "A L O H A :)  The original ocean inspired removable SURFace Graphics. 3rd Ave Shore decals are handmade in Hawaii. It all started in a garage in 2009.  The dream was to create ocean inspired removable wall decals. Maybe a few here and there to support our travel habits :) 6 years later we are now a global wall decal company spreading swell designs around the world. \r\n\r\nAll handmade with aloha.\r\n\r\nSales are usually powered by fellow surf lovers and avid vintage store junkies. A typical buyer carries a laid back attitude, upon arrival of their new wall decal from 3rd Ave Shore there are cases of pure ex-tactic bliss.  Side effects that may occur from our wall decals: Eyestrain from love at first sight, lack of wall space due to over abundance of compulsive purchasing and computer burn outs due to stalking our newest designs. You&#39;ve been warned. \r\n\r\nDo you hate shipping?  Well you don&#39;t anymore.  I have a $7 flat rate for all U.S. orders and a flat $20 rate for all international orders, any items added to the first decal ships for FREE.\r\n\r\nAloha,\r\nSam{antha} Hardin\r\nwww.3rdaveshore.om\r\n\r\nAll artwork is original.\r\n© 2009-2014 3rdAveShore.

This is because \r\n♡1) All of my items are HANDMADE with LOVE! Doing so takes time!\r\n♡2) Sometimes I am waiting on shipment of supplies to arrive which slows down the process, grrrrrrr.....\r\n♡3) I have a paper or exam that I have to take time and focus on for a bit\r\n\r\n♡If you need your product by a certain day you need to message me before purchasing (as said in my policies.) If you forgot to do so, message me and we&#39;ll see what we can do!\r\n\r\n♡This shop is my BABY therefor you are now my BABY and I want to make you as happy as possible! Thank you so much and don&#39;t be afraid to message me with anything at all!\r\nHave a blessed day and STAY DRIZZY! XOXO Makenzie :-)",
