We take pride in knowing our customers are satisfied with our work. Please note that a completed transaction via our Etsy store is a contract between the buyer and seller.  By purchasing item, you understand that an order can not be canceled unless refund is first approved by seller.  Being that our items are usually processed within first 24 hours, we will not accept cancellation requests on orders that are already in processing.  Any approved cancellation will result in refund minus $10 cancellation fee to cover seller fees charged to seller for completed transaction.

No cancelation will be made for orders already made or in casting process.\r\n\r\nAll handmade items should be cared for as such.  For example, we don&#39;t recommend working out or doing yard work in handmade jewelry to prevent breakage.  Care for our jewelry with care and our pieces will give you years of enjoyment.  Being that items are handmade, we do not offer warranty against breaking.  However under certain conditions, we may be able to fix item for free within a reasonable time if the breakage was premature and due to faulty design.  Any item that breaks by fault of customer can be fixed at a fair price only unless the damage is extreme such as intentional neglect or poor care for the item.",

This is a set that I will be continuously adding to, if there is a relatively popular artist that you know and love that is not feature feel free to send over an inquiry as it may be someone I am willing or planning to create a coaster for. ***Keep in my mind that while making this request, that it is unlikely that I will be doing lesser known artists. If he/she is a local or underground artist it would be more of a custom request thus the price and listing will need to be different*** \n\nIf there is a hip hop artist featured on another set that you like and would like to see here i.e Q Tip from ATCQ please see the following listing:https://www.etsy.com/listing/109059238/build-your-own-5pc-coaster-set?ref=shop_home_feat_1d with a 2.0mm thickness. \n\nCoasters are on heavyweight cardboard- 4x4 and 2mm thick this is thicker than the standard bar coaster \n\nCoasters are created using stencils and water proof paint followed by a sealer. Condensation rolls right off.  \n\nSpice up your small party with these mini paintings!\n\nBe sure to state who you want in the notes\nAs pictured left to right\n*Jay Z\n*Nas\n*Tupac\n*ODB\n*Biggie\n*Drake\n*Rick Ross\n*J COle\n*MF DOOM\n*Childish Gambino\n*Kendrick Lamar\n*Mos Def\n*Snoop Dogg\n*Ice Cube\n*Kanye West\n*Eazy E\n\nWomen Just added - \n*Queen Latifah\n*Nicki Minaj\n*Lauryn Hill\n*Missy Elliott\n*Lil Kim\n*Foxy Brown\n(too come MC Lyte, Trina, Left eye, Eve, yoyo, MIA etc)\n\n\nIf you fail to note who you want you will receive the default five plus one selected at random (biggie, tupac, nas, jay z and odb)\n\nThe set is made to order and the color combo  may vary. If you have a preference or would like them all to be one color please let me know in the notes. Standard Colors are always available: blue, red, yellow, green, purple, and orange. Special colors may vary.\n\n\n\n*Domestic shipping price includes tracking and insurance\n*Shipping reflects recent changes in postage prices for shipping outside the US\n\nMore images coming soon",

This is a digital pdf pattern that is available for download instantly upon payment.\r\n\r\nThis pattern is great for a beginner. It uses just backstitch. Instructions are included.\r\n\r\nAll four variations on the pattern are included: &quot;cray&quot;, &quot;cray cray&quot;, &quot;that shit cray&quot; and &quot;dat shit cray&quot;. I think the single and double cray ones would go great stitched up as a pair. \r\n\r\nThe finished stitch shown in the first and third pictures was stitched on 18 count aida fabric and framed in a 3 inch hoop. All four patterns will all fit in a 3 inch hoop when stitched on 14, 16, or 18 count aida fabric.",

If you are unsure, please send me a convo with your height, weight, and bust cup size.\n\nI do screenprint each and every shirt to order when it is ordered specifically for you, so I do not offer carte-blanche refunds, however I do know that situations can arise, and I am probably the most reasonable and compassionate person you&#39;ll ever meet.  Firedaughter&#39;s success has been based partly on this fact.  If you have a problem- which I work crazy-hard to make sure you don&#39;t- just give me a friendly shout.  I love nice people :) XO",

Please bring me a cupcake.\n\nI do not wholesale- I screenprint every single shirt to order and my handmade methods do not lend themselves to wholesale pricing.\n\nYou can have any of my designs on any of my shirts- again, handmade rocks ;)  I do not consider this making a &quot;custom&quot;- as long as it&#39;s a Firedaughter design, there is no extra charge for changing shirt styles/color, or ink color.\n-This is the procedure to order a shirt differently from how you see it in the photos in the listing:\nOrder the size/color/style shirt you want it on, regardless of the design shown on the front.  Then in NOTES TO FIREDAUGHTER when you are checking out, tell me what design you want, and what ink color.  You must order the size/color/style you want- that is the only way to ensure I have that size/color/style in stock.  If you do not see the size/color/style you want in the shop, shoot me a convo to see if I have it.  If it&#39;s not in the shop it usually means it&#39;s been discontinued or backordered, but sometimes it&#39;s just an oversight on my part.\n\n************************************************************************************\n*****I no longer do custom design orders.*****I&#39;ve worked tirelessly for years to establish Firedaughter Clothing as a brand that stands for certain ideals and a certain way of life.  Creating for Firedaughter is my passion, and creating designs on demand that don&#39;t come from my heart takes too much away from Firedaughter and my own love of what I do.    Thank you for understanding.\n****************************************************************************************\n\nI don&#39;t use any type of Photoshop or anything like that on my photos, as I wish to represent my clothing completely accurately.  So I apologize if my hair is flyaway or I have a huge pimple, but I&#39;m keepin&#39; it real ;)\n\nI use only water-based, environmentally friendly permanent screenprinting inks.  Machine wash all of my pretties in cold water, inside out, and tumble dry.  Read the listings so you know which styles shrink and which styles don&#39;t.\n\nI currently use five different tank styles, and the sizes do not run the same for each tank.  It&#39;s very important in my shop to read the listings so you understand the characteristics of the specific shirt you are wanting.  It is VERY helpful to see what sizes I am wearing in the photos- I give my stats and what size I am wearing in each and every listing.  If you are &quot;normally&quot; a size small and you see that I&#39;m wearing a size Large, and we are approx the same size, you will not want to order a small, even if that&#39;s what you normally are.  I provide a lot of tools so to save yourself the headache of a size exchange, use them!  They&#39;re super fun! ;)\n\nLastly, I live and breathe Firedaughter Clothing and Firedaughter Nation.  I am ridiculously earnest and passionate about my clients- I love Firedaughter women as if they were my family.  I am an idealist, and the crap way people treat each other out in the &quot;real world&quot; is not how we treat each other at Firedaughter.  Respect, compassion, admiration, and congeniality live here.  WELCOME!\nXOXO\nSamya",

His art is influenced by the surrounding environment of the ocean and marine creatures. Sunsets, exploding Sailfish, the deep blue / purple hues of the open ocean were just a few of the resources he gathered and implemented in his creations.\r\n     Whether the medium be painting, sculpting, photography, charcoals, apparel or music, his desire to create has led to new ways of expressing his passions. Richard moved to Los Angeles in 1992 and for the past decade, the artist has discovered glitter as a unique medium and has concentrated on refining this aspect of his creations.\r\n     These glitter paintings have been showcased on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno and featured in the home of Bob Marley&#39;s mother. Owners include model Aria Giovanni, Grammy Award winners Dr. John, Cyril Neville, Aaron Neville and Ziggy Marley among others. He has had featured works at L.A. Downtown Art Walk, various underground Los Angeles Art Shows and on Abbot Kinney in Venice Beach California.",
